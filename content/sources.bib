  abstract      = {The flavor and aroma development in fermented foods is intricately tied to the mixing dynamics during fermentation. This review explores how variations in mixing influence the physical, chemical, and microbial interactions within fermentation systems, ultimately affecting sensory characteristics such as flavor and aroma. Factors like rheology, shear forces, and fluid flow patterns are critical in mass transfer, microbial activity, and the release of volatile compounds, contributing to fermented products' sensory profile. Examples from common fermented foods -- including bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and cheese -- highlight how controlled mixing can optimize the release of desirable flavor compounds, improve biosynthesis yields, and reduce technological complexity. Understanding these physical interactions is essential for advancing fermentation processes in the food industry, leading to higher product quality, better flavor retention, and enhanced consumer satisfaction.},

We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits.''

Distant galaxies have all of their visible light shifted into infrared.},

  abstract  = {The compound word ``truth-value'', sometimes written ``truth value'', is a bit monstrous and ambiguous. It is the name of a central concept of modern logic, but has not yet invaded everyday language. An ordinary man will say: it is true that Paris is the capital of France, rather than: the truth-value of ``Paris is the capital of France'' is true. And a mathematician also will say: it is true that 2+3=5, rather than the truth-value of ``2+3=5'' is true. We don't even find ``truth-values'' in postmodern or new age discussions side by side with ``quantum leap'', ``imaginary number'', ``betacognition''. It seems that ``truth-value'' is exclusively used by logicians, philosophers of logic and analytic philosophers. In this paper we will examine the origin of this strange way of speaking and the concept related to it.},

In the velocity selector, there is both a downward directed electric field and a magnetic field directed into the page. The electric field applies a downward force to the particle, and the magnetic field applies a force that is initially upward. Adjust the speed of the particle and observe how the path the particle follows is affected. Only particles that pass undeflected through the velocity selector enter the mass separator, which is simply a region with a uniform magnetic field directed out of the page. The radius of the path followed by a particle is proportional to the mass of the particle, so particles are separated by mass.},

In space, moving hot gas, or `plasma', threaded by a magnetic field emits polarized light. The polarized light rays that manage to escape the pull of the black hole travel to a distant camera. The intensity of those light rays and their direction are what we observe with the Event Horizon Telescope. Today, we reveal a breakthrough discovery: the Event Horizon Telescope has imaged polarized light close to the shadow of M87* for the very first time. Using this knowledge, we can map out the magnetic fields that surround the black hole, and connect them to the powerful jet of plasma it ejects.   The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is an international collaboration that captured the first image of a black hole by creating a virtual Earth-sized telescope.
