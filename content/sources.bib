  abstract  = {The compound word ``truth-value'', sometimes written ``truth value'', is a bit monstrous and ambiguous. It is the name of a central concept of modern logic, but has not yet invaded everyday language. An ordinary man will say: it is true that Paris is the capital of France, rather than: the truth-value of ``Paris is the capital of France'' is true. And a mathematician also will say: it is true that 2+3=5, rather than the truth-value of ``2+3=5'' is true. We don't even find ``truth-values'' in postmodern or new age discussions side by side with ``quantum leap'', ``imaginary number'', ``betacognition''. It seems that ``truth-value'' is exclusively used by logicians, philosophers of logic and analytic philosophers. In this paper we will examine the origin of this strange way of speaking and the concept related to it.},
