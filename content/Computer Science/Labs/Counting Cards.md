## 🔖 Background Information

Let's pretend that we have an array of elements - they might be integers, characters, or cards in a 52-card playing deck. On [this website](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/), Mike Bostock describes three algorithms that can be used to shuffle an array of elements (which can represent cards in a deck) [@bostockFisherYatesShuffle2012]. He claims that the first one is the worst performing algorithm, the second is a small improvement, and the third is the best performer. The third algorithm is known as the Fisher–Yates Algorithm.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Test and comment on Mike Bostock's claim. Do you agree or disagree with his evaluation when you implement the algorithms yourself?

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* Read through the descriptions of the three algorithms written by Mike Bostock on the website linked above.
* Implement the three algorithms listed in his blog post using C++ or Java.
* Test the algorithms using whatever means you determine are appropriate. You can determine how many tests are needed, but I do expect to see at least four different sized arrays with four trials each.
* Answer the Thought-Provoking Questions using your results. Did your fellow classmates reach the same conclusions?

## 📋 Dev Notes

* Note that Mike Bostock wrote the code on his website in Javascript. I don't expect anyone in this class to know how to write Javascript. But I do think you can piece together the meaning of his code samples by reading and reviewing some documentation.
* I would recommend creating a few arrays of differing sizes and running them through the shuffle algorithms for a few trials. A good starting point might be four arrays of different sizes with four trials apiece in each of the three functions (i.e. $4 \times 4 \times 3 = 48$ runs total).
* You can use the built-in timing utilities in C++ and Java to do some basic benchmarking of your code.
* Automation is your friend. Create some for loops to test all of these cases. Don't try to do it all by hand 😅
* You should turn in your implemented algorithms, just like in any other lab.

## 🖥️ Example Output

There is no specific Example Output for this lab. You are testing three algorithms from somebody's writing.

## 📝 Thought Provoking Questions

There is only one overarching question this week.

> Do you agree with Mike Bostock's claims that the three algorithms on his site are listed in order of increasing (better) performance?

* What evidence do you have to support your claim?
* Are there any edge cases that he looked over or missed?
* Do you have any comments or recommendations on how to improve performance further?
* Etc...
