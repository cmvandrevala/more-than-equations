## 🔖 Background Information

This lab is a simple way to make sure that your local setup is working properly. It sets the stage to make sure that you can develop on your workstation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Write a program that prints "Hello World!" to the terminal and then exits gracefully.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* The program should be written in the main language used by the class (e.g. C++, Java, Python, etc.).
* The program should print "Hello World!" to the terminal and then exit gracefully.
* No user input is needed for this problem.

## 📋 Dev Notes

The goal of this assignment is to make sure that your workstation is set up properly, and you are ready to write code. Some things that you might want to consider as you work through this include:

* Do you have a working compiler or interpreter installed on your computer?
* Are you using a recent version of the language?
* Is your text editor set up properly?
* Are there any packages or plugins that you like to use to aid you in development?
* Are there any static analysis tools that you like to use?
* Are there any useful sites or documentation that you want to have bookmarked?
* Is there a build tool that you might need to set up?
* Is there a testing framework that you might need to set up?

## 🖥️ Example Output

The goal of this program is to print "Hello World" out to the screen. This will look different depending on the language that we are using in the class. For example, you might run your program in C++ as follows:

```bash
$ ./hello.out

Hello World!
```

Whereas in Java, you might utilize a build tool like Gradle:

```bash
$ ./gradlew run

Hello World!
```
