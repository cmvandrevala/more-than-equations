description: In this lab, you will build a treemap data structure from the ground up, using a splay tree to store key-value pairs.

## 🔖 Background Information

In a `Map` interface, items are stored as key-value pairs. I should be able to create a new key-value pair, retrieve the value associated with a key, and delete a key-value pair. This might look something like:

```java
Map map = new Map();
map.insert("someKey", "someValue"); // This should save the key-value pair in the map
map.get("someKey");                 // This should return the value "someValue"
map.delete("someKey")               // This should delete the key-value pair in the map
```

There are many different ways to implement a map, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. We are going to focus on tree maps in this lab.

A `TreeMap` is an implementation of the `Map` interface, where the key-value pairs are stored in a binary search tree. The pairs are arranged in the tree by the alphabetical ordering of the keys [@swiniarskiJavaTreeMap2023]. Of course, we want our binary search tree to have some balancing structure so that queries are as efficient as possible. A splay tree is a nice choice when we expect our users to favor the insertion and retrieval of a few specific keys more than others.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Implement a `TreeMap` data structure from scratch using a `SplayTree` under the hood to store key-value pairs.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Your `TreeMap` data structure should have the following methods:

* `insert(string key, string value)` - Inserts a key-value pair into the map.
* `get(string key)` - Returns the value associated with a given key. If the key does not exist, return an empty string or some default value of your choice.
* `delete(string key)` - Deletes the key-value pair associated with a given key. If the key does not exist, you may return an error message or perform no action.

## 📋 Dev Notes

Let's take a moment to try to break down this problem into manageable bite-sized chunks. If we tried to implement everything all at once, we would probably get overwhelmed.

Here is how I might break down this lab:

1. Implement a generic `BinarySearchTree` data structure without any special balancing. You should be able to insert, retrieve, and delete elements from the tree.
2. Rename your `BinarySearchTree` data structure to `SplayTree` and add the splaying operations.
3. Implement a `KeyValuePair` class that stores a string key and a string value. You might want to create getters and setters for those two attributes.
4. Overload the comparison operations on the `KeyValuePair` class. When you compare two `KeyValuePair` objects using `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, or `==`, it should compare the keys of the objects and assess their alphabetical ordering.
5. Create a `TreeMap` class. In the constructor, have it create a `SplayTree<KeyValuePair>` object and save it to a private variable.
6. Write the `insert` method on `TreeMap` which takes a string key and a string value as arguments. It should build a `KeyValuePair` object using the arguments and insert it into the `SplayTree<KeyValuePair>` object.
7. Write the `get` method on `TreeMap` which takes a string key as its argument. It should search the `SplayTree<KeyValuePair>` object for the key and return its corresponding value.
8. Write the `delete` method on `TreeMap` which takes a string key as its argument. It should search the `SplayTree<KeyValuePair>` object for the key and delete the entry.

## 🖥️ Example Output

I might expect to see the `TreeMap` class used like this:

>   // Prints out valueOne
>   std::cout << map.get("keyOne");
>

>   std::cout << map.get("keyThree");
>
>   // Prints out an empty string or some default value of your choice
>   std::cout << map.get("keyDoesNotExist");
>
>   // Deletes the key-value pair from the tree map
>   std::cout << map.delete("keyOne");

## 📝 Thought Provoking Questions

1. Suppose a user inserts a few hundred million items into your `TreeMap` as a storage structure. After that, you determine that 90% of their queries involve retrieving the value for one specific key and the remaining 10% of the queries involve retrieving the values for other random keys. Describe the expected performance of your `TreeMap` data structure in this case.
2. Suppose a user inserts a few hundred million items into your `TreeMap` as a storage structure. After that, you determine that there is no discernable pattern in how they retrieve values. It is equally likely that any key-value pair will be accessed. Describe the expected performance of your `TreeMap` data structure in this case.
