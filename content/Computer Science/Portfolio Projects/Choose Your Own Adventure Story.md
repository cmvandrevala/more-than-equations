## 🔖 Background Information

A choose your own adventure story is a story, generally written from a second-person point of view, where the reader makes choices that determine the actions of the main character and the outcome of the plot. In this portfolio, you are going to create a (very) small choose your own adventure story.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Create a choose your own adventure story that asks the user a series of questions and guides them through a short story. Your story must contain the elements outlined in the Acceptance Criteria.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* Your story must ask the user at least two questions before concluding.
* For each question of the story, there should be at least two options to choose from.
* Your story should have at least one "random" element which uses the `rand()` function in C++.
* Your story should have at least one "looping" element which uses a `for` or `while` loop in C++.
* Your story must contain at least one piece of ASCII art.

## 📋 Dev Notes

* You do not need to handle erroneous input from the user. You can assume that the user will always choose one of the options that you specified.

## 🖥️ Example Output

A choose your own adventure story might look something like this:

```text
./adventure.out

       !
      .-.
    __|=|__
   (_/`-`\_)
   //\___/\\
   <>/   \<>
    \|_._|/
     <_I_>
      |||
jgs  /_|_\
