1. Compute each of the following summations by hand. Show all of your work.

$$
\sum_{k = -2}^2 (1 - k)^2
$$

<div style="margin-bottom:2rem;"></div>

$$
\sum_{i = 0}^4 3^i
$$

<div style="margin-bottom:2rem;"></div>

$$
\sum_{i = 3}^{7} \left \lfloor \frac{i}{4} \right \rfloor
$$

2. Compute the Big-O value for $f(n) = 2^{n + 1} + n$. Justify your answer.

3. Compute the Big-Omega value for $f(n) = n^2 + 4n + 5$. Justify your answer.

4. Compute the Big-Theta value for $f(n) = n log n + 10 log n$. Justify your answer.

5. Show that if $d(n)$ is $O(f(n))$ and $e(n)$ is $O(g(n))$, then $d(n) + e(n)$ is O(f(n) + O(g(n)))$.

5. Proof by induction

6. Proof by contradiction

7. Algorithm
 executes an
-time computation for each entry of an array storing
 elements. What is its worst-case running time?
