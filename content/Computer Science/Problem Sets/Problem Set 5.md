1. Write the pseudocode for an algorithm that finds the value stored in the second to last node of a singly linked list of unknown size. You can assume that the last node has `NULL` or `nullptr` set as its `next` value and there is a reference to the `HEAD` of the linked list which can be passed into your method / function.

2. Write the pseudocode for an algorithm that reverses a singly linked list of unknown size using O(1) space. You can assume that the last node has `NULL` or `nullptr` set as its `next` value and there is a reference to the `HEAD` of the linked list which can be passed into your method / function.

3. Write the pseudocode for an algorithm that takes two doubly linked lists and returns `true` if they store the same sequence of elements or `false` otherwise. You can assume that the ends of each doubly linked list are bounded by sentinel nodes.

4. According to your textbook:

> An iterator is a software design pattern that abstracts the process of scanning through a sequence of elements, one element at a time. The underlying elements might be stored in a container class, streaming through a network, or generated by a series of computations.

What the heck does this mean? What are iterators good for? Why should I care about them? Explain it to me like I am a novice software developer seeing them in C++ / Java for the first time.
