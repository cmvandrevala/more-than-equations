## 🎯 Problem Statement

Write a program that takes an x and y coordinate from a user and plots that point on the console by drawing a set of axes via ASCII characters.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* A user should be able to enter the x and y coordinates of a point.
* Each coordinate will be an integer greater than zero.
* The program should print out a set of axes as well as the plotted point on the console.
* You should make good use of functions to ensure that your program does not become difficult to read.

## 📋 Dev Notes

* You do not have to worry about plotting points along the x-axis or y-axis.
* You do not need to write any validation of the inputted coordinates.
* Think about how you can effectively use functions to ensure that your code is easy to follow and removes duplication.

## 🖥️ Example Output

```bash
./plot.out

Enter the x-coordinate that you want to plot: 5
Enter the y-coordinate that you want to plot: 2
