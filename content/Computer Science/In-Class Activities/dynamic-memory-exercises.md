## üîñ Background Information

Dynamic memory allocation is a technique where we can allocate, utilize, and eventually return blocks of memory on the heap. This gives us the flexibility to create data structures that can shrink and grow throughout the life of our program.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Complete the following exercises:

1. Write a program to dynamically allocate three variables on the heap: an integer, a character, and a string. Assign a value to each of them after they have been allocated and print them out to the console. Be sure to clean them up properly after you have printed them to the console.
2. Write a program to dynamically allocate an array of ten integers. Initialize its elements with the numbers one through ten and print them out to the console. Be sure to clean up the array after you have printed its values to the console.
3. Write a program to dynamically create an object of a class using the `new` operator. You can create your own custom class for this exercise. Then, call the desctructor on the object to clean it up.
4. Write a program to dynamically create an array of objects using the `new` operator. You can use the custom class that you created in the previous exercise here. Be sure to clean up your objects and array afterwards.
5. Write a program to dynamically allocate a two-dimensional array of float values. Initialize all of its elements with zeros and print them out to the console. Be sure to clean up the array after you have printed its values to the console.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

* You should write a short program for each of the questions listed in the Problem Statement.
