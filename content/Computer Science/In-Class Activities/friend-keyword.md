## 🔖 Background Information

We are going to use some of the code examples from class to get some practice with friend functions in C++.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Perform the actions outlined in the Acceptance Criteria.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

1. Fork the `csc_122_friend_keyword` repository on GitHub so that you have your own copy of the code.
2. In the file called `1_getters.cpp`, create a new function called `swap` that will swap the height and width of a `Rectangle`. You should use getters and setters - use the `scale` function as a guide.
3. In the file called `2_friend_functions.cpp`, create a new function called `swap` that will swap the height and width of a `Rectangle`. You should use the friend keyword - use the `scale` function as a guide.
4. In the file called `3_friend_classes.cpp`, create a new class called `GeometricSwapper`. This class will swap the height and width of a `Rectangle`. You should use the friend keyword - use the `GeometricScalar` class as a guide.
