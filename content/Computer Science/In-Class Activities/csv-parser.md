## 🔖 Background Information

A parser is a program that takes some input and turns it into structured data. For example, you might have a "lexical parser" which takes a sentence (string) as an input and turns it into an array of words. In this problem, we have a "CSV parser" - a program which takes a CSV file, reads it, and turns it into a map of rows and keys. Parsers are useful because they take potentially messy, unfiltered data and give it a structure that is easy to understand and use.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Read through the code in the csvstream repository that gives an implementation of a CSV parser [@deorioAwdeorioCsvstream2024]. Then, answer the following questions with your group members:

1. In which file is the actual source code located? What are the other files doing in the project?
2. Does this project include tests? If so, how does the author test their code?
3. What is an `enum` in C++?
4. How does the `csvstream` class work, at a high level?
5. What are some of the data structures used in this program? How are they used?

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Answer the questions outlined above in the problem statement. Your group will share one or more of your answers with the class.

## 📋 Dev Notes

You do not need to write any code in this activity. However, it may be useful to sketch out a diagram to help visualize how csvstream works.
