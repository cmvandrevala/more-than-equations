title: CSV Parser

## 🔖 Background Information

A parser is a program that takes some input and turns it into structured data. For example, you might have a "lexical parser" which takes a sentence (string) as an input and turns it into a set of words. In this problem, we have a "CSV parser" - a program which takes a CSV file, reads it, and turns it into a map of rows and keys. Parsers are useful because they take potentially messy, unfiltered data and turn it into a structure that is easy to use in your program.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Read through the code in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream/) that gives an implementation of a CSV parser. Then, answer the following questions with your group members:

1. In which file is the actual source code located? What are the other files doing in the project?
2. Does this project include tests? If so, how does the author test their code?
3. What is an enum in C++?
4. How does the `csvstream` class work, at a high level?
5. What are some of the data structures used in this program? How are they used?

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Answer the questions outlined above in the problem statement. Your group will share one or more of your answers with the class.
