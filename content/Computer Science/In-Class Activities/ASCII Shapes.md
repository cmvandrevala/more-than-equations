## 🔖 Background Information

N/A

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Create a program that asks a user if they want to draw a square or a right triangle in the console as well as its size. Then, draw the shape based on their inputs.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* When I start the program, I expect to see a prompt asking me if I want to draw a square or triangle.
* After I specify the shape, I expect to see a prompt asking me how big the shape should be.
* Finally, the program should print out a nicely formatted shape to the console based on my inputs.

## 📋 Dev Notes

* You do not need to worry about invalid input from the user at this point in time.

## 🖥️ Example Output

If a user selects the "square" option, your output might look something like this:

```bash
$ ./ascii_shapes.out

Welcome to the ASCII Shapes program! Would you like to draw a (1) square or (2) triangle?

1

Great choice! How big do you want the side length to be?

5

Here is your square:

* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * *

```

If a user selects the "triangle" option, your output might look something like this:

```bash
$ ./ascii_shapes.out

Welcome to the ASCII Shapes program! Would you like to draw a (1) square or (2) triangle?

2

Great choice! How big do you want the side length to be?
