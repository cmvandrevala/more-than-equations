## üìù Practice Problems

**Vector Operations**: Consider vector $$\vec{D} = 3 \hat{i} - 4\hat{j} + 2\hat{k}$$ and vector $$\vec{E} = 4 \hat{i} - 2\hat{j} - 2\hat{k}$$

* Sketch out a diagram of the setup.
* What is $$\vec{D} + \vec{E}$$ ?
* What is $$\vec{D} - \vec{E}$$ ?
* What is $$\vec{D} \cdot \vec{E}$$ ?
* What is $$\vec{D} \times \vec{E}$$ ?

**Moving Car**: A car moves 150 meters at 63$$^\circ$$ north of east. It then moves 300 meters at 34$$^\circ$$ south of west. What is the final position of the car?

**Vectors on a Pentagon**: Suppose I construct a regular pentagon with side length equal to one using five vectors. The five vectors all lie tip to tail.

* Sketch out a diagram of the setup.
* Write out each vector in array or $$\hat{i}$$, $$\hat{j}$$, $$\hat{k}$$ format.
* What is the sum of the five vectors?
* How does the sum change if you double the length of each vector?
* How does the sum change if you reverse the direction of each vector?
