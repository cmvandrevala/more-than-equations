**Field Strength Away From Earth**: The gravitational field strength at the surface of the Earth is 9.8 $$m/s^2$$.
    *How far above the Earth would the field strength be $$2/3$$ the value at the surface?
    * How far above the Earth would the field strength be $$1/3$$ the value at the surface?

**Gravitational Force From Sun and Moon**: Calculate the net gravitational force on the Moon from the Earth and Sun during a lunar eclipse (i.e. the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon). Do the same for a solar eclipse (i.e. the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun). You might find it useful to refer to the table of astrophysical data in your book.

**Binary Star System**: A binary star system consists of two stars with masses $$M$$ and $$4M$$ that are a distance $$d$$ apart.
    *Sketch a diagram of the system with arrows showing the direction of the gravitational field around the stars.
    * Where would the gravitational field be equal to zero around these stars?
