## 📋 Sequence

* Vocabulary
  * Wave - A disturbance in a medium that carries energy without the net movement of particles
  * Transverse Wave (S Wave) - Motion of particles is perpendicular to propagation
  * Longitudinal Wave (P Wave) - Motion of particles is parallel to propagation
  * Crest vs. Trough
  * Wavelength
  * Frequency
  * Harmonic wave - Sinusoidal shape
  * Traveling wave - Retains it shape as it moves
  * Superposition - When two or more waves overlap, the net disturbance is the sum of the disturbances due to each wave
* What does it mean for a wave to have a velocity?
* What are some of the assumptions we make about waves propagating in a medium?
* Harmonic traveling wave equation: $$y(x,t) = A sin(\omega t \pm kx + \phi)$$
* Harmonic traveling wave speed:
  * Set phase equal to zero
  * Set $$C = \omega t \pm kx$$
  * Solve for $$x/t$$
  * $$k$$ is your wavenumber $$k = \omega/v =2\pi f / \lambda f = 2\pi / \lambda$$
  * \\(v = \omega / k = f\lambda \\)
* Sketch a few harmonic traveling waves
