## üìù Practice Problems

**Vector in a 2D Coordinate Grid**: Let $$\vec{A}$$ be a vector starting at (3, 5) and ending at (-1, 9).

* Sketch out a diagram of the setup.
* Write out $$\vec{A}$$ in array format.
* Write out $$\vec{A}$$ in $$\hat{i}$$, $$\hat{j}$$, $$\hat{k}$$ format.
* What is the magnitude of $$\vec{A}$$?
* What angle does $$\vec{A}$$ make with the positive x-axis?

**Vector in a 3D Coordinate Grid**: Let $$\vec{A}$$ be a vector starting at (-7, 15, 11) and ending at (-1, -3, -5).

* Sketch out a diagram of the setup.
* Write out $$\vec{A}$$ in array format.
* Write out $$\vec{A}$$ in $$\hat{i}$$, $$\hat{j}$$, $$\hat{k}$$ format.
* What is the magnitude of $$\vec{A}$$?

**Scalar Triple Product**: Although we (probably) won't use it in this class, the scalar triple product gives the volume of a parallelepiped defined by three vectors. It is defined by: $$V = \vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c})$$

* Is the calculated value of the scalar triple product a scalar or a vector? How do you know?
* Calculate the scalar triple product for $$\vec{a} = 5\hat{i} + 3\hat{j} - 2\hat{k}$$, $$\vec{b} = 2\hat{i} + 3\hat{k}$$, and $$\vec{c} = -13\hat{i} - 3\hat{j} - 1\hat{k}$$
* What happens to the scalar triple product if $$\vec{b}$$ is parallel to $$\vec{c}$$?
* What happens to the scalar triple product if $$\vec{b}$$ is anti-parallel to $$\vec{c}$$?
* What happens to the scalar triple product if $$\vec{a}$$ is perpendicular to $$\vec{b} \times \vec{c}$$?

**Dimensional Analysis**: After experimenting in the lab, I have determined a potential equation that relates the amount of liquid flowing in a pipe to the flow and pipe area. Use dimensional analysis to determine if the following equation could be valid:

$$
V = C J A^2
$$

* Volumetric Flow Rate (V) = Volume Per Unit Time
* Flow Velocity (J) = Length Covered by Liquid Per Unit Time
* Cross-Sectional Vector Area (A) = Cross-Sectional Area of the Pipe
