## üìù Practice Problems

**Firing an Arrow**: An arrow is shot from a bow and arrow with an initial speed v = 10 m/s at an angle of $$30^\circ$$ above the ground.

* What is the time of flight?
* What is the horizontal distance covered?
* What is the maximum height?
* What is the angle at which it hits the ground?

**Throwing a Ball Off a Cliff**: A ball is thrown with an initial speed v = 10 m/s at an angle of $$30^\circ$$ off a cliff that is 20 meters above the ground.

* What is the time of flight?
* What is the horizontal distance covered?
* What is the maximum height?
* What is the angle at which it hits the ground?

**Projectile Fired From a Cannon**: A cannonball is fired from a cannon located and flies in an arc towards a target that is 75 meters away. After five seconds of flight, it hits the target.

* What is the maximum height?
