**A Car Accelerating on a Flat Road**: A car starts from rest on a long length of straight road. It accelerates at 10 $$m/s^2$$ for 5 seconds and then continues to cruise down the road at constant velocity.

* Draw the position vs. time graph for the car between zero and ten seconds.
* Draw the velocity vs. time graph for the car between zero and ten seconds.
* Draw the acceleration vs. time graph for the car between zero and ten seconds.
* What is the instantaneous velocity at t = 5 seconds?
* What is the average velocity over the ten second period?

**A Car Braking on a Flat Road**: A car with a mass of 500 kg is traveling at a constant speed of 20 m/s on long length of straight road. Seeing an obstacle ahead, the driver brakes suddenly, slowing down at a rate of 10 $$m/s^2$$ until they come to a complete stop.

* Draw the position vs. time graph for the car.
* Draw the velocity vs. time graph for the car.
* Draw the acceleration vs. time graph for the car.
* What is the angle between the velocity vector and the acceleration vector of the car as it slows down?

**A Ball Thrown Up Into the Air**: A child throws a ball straight up into the air with an initial speed of 5 m/s.

* Draw the position vs. time graph for the ball.
* Draw the velocity vs. time graph for the ball.
* Draw the acceleration vs. time graph for the ball.
* What is the equation of the line for the velocity vs. time graph in slope-intercept form?
* How long after the child throws the ball does it reach its maximum height?

**F1 Car**: F1 cars use a combination of powerful engines and aerodynamic design to maneuver effectively. A modern F1 car can go from zero to 100 km/hr in about 2.6 seconds and from 100 km/hr to 200 km/hr in about 1.9 seconds. They can decelerate from 200 km/hr back to zero in around 3 seconds. Suppose a driver starts an F1 car at rest and accelerates at full throttle until they reach 200 km/hr. They cruise at this velocity for 5 seconds before slamming the breaks and coming to a full stop.

* Draw the position vs. time graph for the car.
* Draw the velocity vs. time graph for the car.
* Draw the acceleration vs. time graph for the car.
* What is the G force on the driver during the initial acceleration from 0 - 100 km/hr?
* What is the G force on the driver during the acceleration from 100 - 200 km/hr?
* What is the G force on the driver while braking from 200 km/hr to a full stop?
Hint: The G force the amount of acceleration a body feels in terms of the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the Earth. GForce = Acceleration / g
