## üìù Practice Problems

**Dropping a Pebble**: A student drops a pebble from the edge of a vertical cliff. The pebble hits the ground four seconds after it was dropped. What is the height of the cliff?

**Kangaroo**: A kangaroo is capable of jumping to a vertical height of 2.62 m. Determine the takeoff speed of the kangaroo.

**Acceleration of a Dragster**: A dragster accelerates to a speed of 112 m/s over a distance of 398 m. Determine the acceleration (assume uniform) of the dragster.

**Velocity of a Bike**: A bike is traveling at a velocity of 4 m/s to the north. The biker accelerates with an acceleration of 0.1 $$m/s^2$$ to the south for five seconds. What is the final velocity of the bike?

**Top Speed of a Sloth**: A three-toed sloth can achieve a top speed of 0.17 mph (0.076 m/s). If we assume that a sloth can achieve this speed in 3 seconds, what is the acceleration of the sloth?
