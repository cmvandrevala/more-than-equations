## üìù Practice Problems

1. Two point charges, each with a charge of +1.5 mC are separated by a distance of 5.75 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between the point charges? Do they attract or repel each other?

1. A point charge of +15 $$\mu C$$ is located at the point (1 m, 2 m). Another point charge of -15 $$\mu C$$ is located at the point (0 m, -5 m). What is the electric force acting on the negative point charge from the positive one?

1. A charge of 10 $$\mu C$$ is positioned at the origin while another charge of -30 $$\mu C$$ is positioned at the point (5 cm, 0 cm). Where around the two points (if anywhere) is the net electric force on a positive point charge equal to zero?
