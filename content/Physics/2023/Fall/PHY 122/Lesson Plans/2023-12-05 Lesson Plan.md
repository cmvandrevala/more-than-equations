## üìù Topics

* Nuclear physics vocabulary
* The mass defect
* The strong force
* Binding energy
* Types of nuclear radiation

## ‚úÖ Sequence

* Set the stage: Two blobs fly towards each other at relativistic speed and stick together. What is the change in mass of the blobs?
* Vocabulary
	* Nucleon - a particle that is found in the nucleus of an atom (i.e. a proton or a neutron)
	* Nucleon number (A) - the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus, also called the mass number
	* Atomic number (Z) - the number of protons in an atom
	* Isotope - an atom with a specific number of protons, but different masses due to different numbers of neutrons
	* Atomic mass unit - 1/12 the mass of a neutral $^{12}C$ atom. $1 \: u = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \: kg$. Nucleons have a mass approximately equal to 1 u.
* Radius of a nucleus:
	* $r = r_o A^{1/3}$ where $r_o \approx 1.2 \:fm$
* Coulomb force between two protons:
	* $F = kq^2/r^2 = (9e9)(1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2/(1 \times 10^{-15})^2 \approx 230 \: N$
	* $F = ma \Rightarrow a = (230 \: N)/(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \: kg) = 1.38 \times 10^{29} \: m/s^2$
	* Why doesn't the universe just explode and everything die?
* Strong force
	* There is a very short range force that holds nucleons together
	* Comparison of strong force to electromagnetism / gravity
	* Where does the strong force come from?
* The mass deficit
	* The mass of Z protons and N neutrons is not equal to the measured mass of a nucleus
	* Example problem: What is the binding energy of the $^{14}N$ nucleus?
* The binding energy curve
* How nuclei become more stable?
	* Disintegration energy - the amount of rest energy that gets turned into other forms of energy
	* Alpha decay
	* Beta decay
	* Electron capture
	* Gamma decay
	* Other modes
* Half life
	* 1 becquerel (Bq) is the unit of one decay per second
	* We could, theoretically, use $R(t) = R_o e^{-t/\tau}$ to characterize nuclear decay
	* We instead use half life $N(t) = N_o (1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$

## ‚úèÔ∏è Practice Problems

1. Radon-222 is a radioactive gas that can sometimes be produced by the alpha decay of a parent nuclide. What is the parent nuclide?
2. Manganese-54 has a half-life of 312 days. What fraction of nuclei in a sample of Mn-54 decay during a period of 936 days?
3. What is the binding energy of deuteron ($^2H$). The mass of a deuteron nucleus is 2.013553 u. Hint: it is helpful to do the calculation in terms of atomic mass units instead of kilograms. Then, you can convert units using  $1 \: u c^2 = 931.494 \: MeV$
4. Write out the reaction when sodium-22 decays by electron capture. Hint: don't forget the neutrino!
5. Write out the reaction when sodium-22 decays by emitting a positron. Hint: don't forget the neutrino!

## Partial Solutions

2. 7/8 of them decay, 1/8 remains
3. 2.225 MeV
