## üìù Topics

* Time dilation
* Length contraction

## üéØ Objectives

* Calculate the length contraction of a moving body

## ‚úÖ Sequence



* Galilean relativity: $\vec{v}_{AC} = \vec{v}_{AB} + \vec{v}_{BC}$
* Relativistic train
	* If a train is traveling at $c/2$ and emits a pulse of light, what does the person on the platform down the tracks see?
	* Maxwell's equations say the speed of light is a constant in a vacuum
* A fun intro video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajhFNcUTJI0
* If you observe light within the framework of Galilean relativity, light can have different velocities. Consider the spaceship thought experiment:
	* Galilean relativity
	* Special relativity
* When you are working in the framework of special relativity, you have to think of everything as events in spacetime.
* Newtonian physics is an approximation of special relativity at low speeds
	* Why don't we see relativistic effects in our day to day lives?
	* The¬†NASA¬†Parker Solar Probe¬†has become the fastest human-made object ever recorded ‚Äî again. On Sept. 27, the probe reached a blistering 394,736 mph/ (635,266 km/h) as it swooped close to the sun's surface, thanks to a little gravity assistance from a close flyby of Venus on Aug. [Parker Probe](https://www.space.com/nasa-parker-solar-probe-fastest-man-made-object-breaks-record#:~:text=The%20NASA%20Parker%20Solar%20Probe,flyby%20of%20Venus%20on%20Aug.). This is 176,462.778 m/s, giving a Lorentz factor of 1.000000173

- Example: At the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), subatomic particles were accelerated to high energies over a straight path whose proper length is 3.2 km. During a particular experiment, electrons were accelerated to 0.9999995c.
	1. In the SLAC reference frame, how long would it take for the electrons to travel this far? ($1.07 \times 10^{-5}$ s)
	2. How long would it take in the electrons‚Äô frame of reference? ($1.07 \times 10^{-8}$ s)
	3. How far would the electrons travel in their frame of reference? (3.21 m)

* Relativistic velocity transformation: $v_{PA} = \frac{v_{PB} + v_{BA}}{1 + v_{PB} v_{BA} / c^2}$

* Example: Suppose a spaceship heading directly toward Earth at half the¬†speed of light sends a signal to us on a¬†laser-produced beam of light. Given that the light leaves the ship at speed c as observed from the ship, calculate the speed at which it approaches Earth.
* Example: Suppose a spaceship heading directly toward Earth at half the¬†speed of light sends a signal to us via a probe traveling at 0.5c. Calculate the speed at which it approaches Earth.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Practice Problems

1. Which of the following situations are inertial reference frames?
	* Standing on the surface of a planet that is rotating along an axis
	* Falling due to the acceleration of gravity
	* Moving with a constant velocity of half the speed of light away from the Earth.
2. Event A happens at the spacetime coordinates $(t, x, y, z) = (0.10 \: s, 0.00 \: m, 0.00 \: m, 0.00 \: m)$. Event B happens at the spacetime coordinates $(t, x, y, z) = (0.11 \: s, 2.00 \times 10^8 \: m, 2.00 \times 10^8 \: m, 1.00 \times 10^8 \: m)$. Could event A have caused event B? Why?
3. An astronaut wears a new watch on a journey where their shuttle is flying at a speed of $\beta = 2/3$. According to Mission Control on Earth, the journey lasted 12 hours. How long was the trip as measured by the astronaut?
4. A spaceship is traveling away from the Earth at 0.87c. The astronauts report home by radio every 12 hours, according to the clocks on the shuttle. At what interval are the reports sent to Earth, according to the clocks on Earth?
5. Two spaceships, each with a length of 30.0 m are flying directly towards each other with a relative speed of 0.90c. How long is one approaching spaceship as measured by the other?
6. Alice is moving at a speed of $2.3 \times 10^5$ m/s in the $+\hat{x}$ direction while Bob is traveling at a speed of $1.1 \times 10^5$ m/s in the $-\hat{x}$ direction. What is Alice's speed according to Bob if we were working with the Galilean approximation?
7. Two spaceships travel at a high speed in the same direction. An observer on a nearby planet measures the speed of ship 1 as 0.80c and the speed of ship 2 as 0.75c. The observer, ship 1, and ship 2 are all along a straight line, in that order. How fast is ship 2 traveling according to ship 1? If you are having trouble, check out Example 26.3 in the textbook.
