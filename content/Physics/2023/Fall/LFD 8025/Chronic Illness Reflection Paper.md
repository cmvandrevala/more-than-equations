For my third reflection paper, I would like to write about a few people who have had to deal with chronic illness in their lives. These are people who I have known at different stages of my life, from high school up until present day. They all had learned to cope or are currently learning to cope with their respective illnesses.

## Friend With PKU

One of the first people that I ever met who suffered from a chronic illness was one of my friends in high school; this person suffered from Phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is a condition where the enzyme needed to break down the amino acid phenylalanine is not present in sufficient quantities in the body. Without it, a buildup of amino acids can develop in the body, causing serious health problems. This friend had to closely monitor his intake of proteins and aspartame since these foods made him "drunk" at low concentrations and could seriously affect his nervous system at higher concentrations.

Fortunately, this friend had a great support system to help him manage his lifestyle and symptoms. First and foremost, his family was very diligent in helping him manage his diet from a young age. Thus, he grew up knowing how to look for problem foods and regulate his intake of proteins. He carried medication with him should he want to eat a protein-rich meal and was very good about not overdoing it when he occasionally did eat something like red meat. The people in his friend circle (myself included) all knew about his condition and tried to make sure that we chose food options that were friendly to his diet.

This friend also worked to stay healthy to the best of his abilities. He was on the gymnastics and diving teams in high school, and he was diligent about trying to stay in shape. I have no doubt that keeping track of his physical health also helped him manage his diet.

Later in life, this friend took part in an experimental study for the treatment of PKU. I remember that the treatment was successful for him, and he could eat some amount of red meat on a regular basis (again, in moderation). Funny enough, he said that he received so many steak dinners after the study that he got sick of steak!

## Mentor With an Aversion to Strong Odors

The second person that I met with a chronic illness was a friend and mentor as an undergraduate student. She had a variety of health problems, but one thing that stood out to me that relates to the readings that we did was that she was very sensitive to smells. She had signs on the doors of her office as well as her home asking people to refrain from using heavy perfumes because they could cause her difficulty with breathing. She had even told us a handful of stories where students would come into office hours with heavy cologne or perfume, and she would have to ask them to leave.

I do not know specifically what condition this person had (nor did I feel like it was my place to ask). However, she did openly talk about sensitivity to foods and smells at times.

## Colleague With Crohn's Disease

The next person that I knew with a chronic illness was an older colleague from when I was in graduate school. This person suffered from Crohn's disease, causing her to have a very restricted diet. Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the digestive tract, usually targeting the small and large intestine. Her condition was particularly bad, causing her a lot of pain and discomfort at times. She would sometimes need to take a bit of time off of work to manage her symptoms and recover from a bad episode.

Like my high school friend with PKU, we tried to make sure that we frequented restaurants that my colleague could enjoy. She told us that she was averse to a variety of foods, some of which I would have never had guessed - e.g. sulfides in dried fruits and most wines. Also, like my friend with PKU, she had been managing her symptoms for most of her life. Thus, she had a very good grasp on what she could or could not eat and naturally self-regulated. Unlike my friend with PKU, there was no magic enzyme or pill that she could take to enjoy a glass of wine.

One thing that I remember about this colleague was that she was very good at managing her schedule around her condition. For example, if she had to miss a meeting or class due to her illness, she would proactively communicate that she was unable to make it and reschedule. I feel like this was a necessary habit that she had to learn to build trust in an academic setting so that others knew that she was not flaking out on them. She had mentioned that work was often difficult for her because she had to be absent sporadically, which made many employers reluctant to hire her.

## Friend With Celiac Disease

After graduate school, I worked as a software consultant at a company called 8th Light. There, I became good friends with a coworker and his family. A couple of years ago, his wife was diagnosed with Celiac disease after she had been complaining of intestinal distress as well as other symptoms. Unfortunately, this was a very difficult diagnosis for her because it meant that she had to go through her diet and figure out what, specifically, was causing her issues. She is an Indian woman, and a lot of the comfort foods from her childhood (especially the spicy ones) had to be abandoned. This is tough for me to imagine - I love cooking, and I love eating (probably a bit too much). The idea of giving up my family's curries would be a huge blow.

On a positive note, her symptoms are under control. She has found alternatives to some of the foods that she likes to eat and is managing her symptoms well. She has also starting visiting the gym to stay in shape and manage symptoms.

## Some of My Thoughts

The first thing I want to mention is that although I mentioned a specific illness for each person, chronic illness has an annoying habit of not falling neatly into a single category. For example, my friend with Crohn's disease certainly had the symptoms for it. However, she also exhibited a number of other symptoms that might not necessarily be aligned with Crohn's (e.g. headaches). A lot of times, doctors will try their best to categorize the illness, but the best they can do is put you in the category that matches most of your symptoms and / or seems to provide the best treatment.

Furthermore, even if an accurate diagnosis of the chronic illness is made, treating the disease involves a surprising amount of guess and check. For example, my friend with Celiac disease had to keep a careful log of the foods that she ate so that she could identify what was causing her intestinal distress. Although there are some overarching patterns that affect people, there is some amount of individual diagnosis that needs to happen.

Physical fitness is important for some of the people that I have met with chronic illness. When I say fitness, I want to clarify that it is fitness aligned with their capabilities and body type. For example, my friend with PKU was very much an athlete, and worked hard to compete as a diver and gymnast. Conversely, my friend with Celiac's disease is not an athlete, but she visits the gym regularly to stay in shape. I think part of it is being able to keep yourself fit gives you some control over your physical being. You learn to treasure your health when you have to deal with some of these chronic illnesses.

My last thought is that for all of the people that I mentioned above, after awhile, it becomes natural to manage their symptoms. I can recall numerous conversations with my friend with PKU where people asked "don't you regret not being able to eat steak?". His answer was simply that it really isn't part of his life, so he doesn't think about it too much. He doesn't need steak to be happy. I respect the mental fortitude that comes from having to contend with a chronic illness.
