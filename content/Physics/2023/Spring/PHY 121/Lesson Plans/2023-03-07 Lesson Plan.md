## Practice

**Ranking Kinetic Energy**: Rank the following scenarios in terms of least to most kinetic energy:
* A 5000 kg elephant walking at 3 m/s
* A 100 kg man skateboarding at 15 m/s
* A 100,000 kg whale drifting along at 0.5 m/s
* A 30 kg eagle diving at 50 m/s
* A 50 kg cheetah running at 30 m/s

**Weightlifter**: A 10 kg weight is sitting on the floor of the gym (let's call this the origin). A weightlifter lifts and lowers the weight as part of their exercise routine.
* What is the work done by gravity if the lifter brings the weight from the ground up to a height of 1.5 m?
* What is the work done by the lifter if they bring the weight from the ground up to a height of 1.5 m?
* What is the work done by gravity if the lifter brings the weight from a height of 1.5 meters down to the ground?
* What is the work done by the lifter if they bring the weight from a height of 1.5 meters down to the ground?
* What is the net work done by gravity if the lifter brings the weight from the ground to a height of 1.5 meters and then back down to the ground?
* What is the net work done by the lifter if they bring the weight from the ground to a height of 1.5 meters and then back down to the ground?

**Force on a Nail**: The force that must be exerted on a nail to drive it into a wall is plotted below. The first 1.2 cm are through soft drywall while the remaining distance is for a wooden stud. How much work must be done to hammer the nail 5 cm into the wall?

**Falling Rock**: A rock falls from a height of 2 meters off the ground. What is its speed right before it hits the Earth?
* Calculate its final speed using the kinematics equations
* Calculate its final speed using the work-kinetic energy theorem
* Calculate its final speed using conservation of mechanical energy

**Oscillations of a Pendulum**: A pendulum is hung from the ceiling from a string of length 10 meters. I start the pendulum at an angle of $5^\circ$ from its resting point. 
* What is the maximum gravitational potential energy of the pendulum?
* What is the maximum kinetic energy of the pendulum?
* Plot the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum as a function of time
* Plot the kinetic energy of the pendulum as a function of time

**Cart on a Rolling Hill**: A cart moving to the right passes point one at a speed of 20 m/s. See the diagram below
* What is the speed of the cart as it passes point 2?
* What is the speed of the cart as it passes point 3?
* Will the cart reach point 4? If so, what will its speed be?
* Roughly plot the kinetic and potential energy of the cart system as a function of horizontal position.

**Gravitational and Spring Potential Energy**: A 2.0 kg block is released from rest and allowed to slide down a frictionless surface into a spring. The far end of the spring is attached to a wall. The initial height of the block is 0.50 meters above the lowest part of the slide. The spring constant of the spring is 450 N/m.
* What is the maximum compression of the spring?
* How high does the block rise up the slide after the spring sends it back to the left?
* Suppose there was a small amount of friction between the block and the floor. Would the final position of the block be higher, lower, or the same height?
