ðŸ“† Next Lesson: [[2023-03-14 Lesson Plan]]

## Topics

* Elastic Potential Energy
* Gravitational Potential Energy for an Orbit

## Objectives

* Utilize the work-kinetic energy theorem and the conversation of mechanical energy to solve a variety of problems
* Choose between conservation of energy or Newton's laws to solve problems

## Sequence

* Additional practice problems for energy
* Free fall lab

## Practice

**Escape Velocity**: What is the escape velocity of the Earth?

**Mass Hanging From a Spring**: A mass M is hanging from a spring with a spring constant k. It is at rest.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the setup
* How much does the spring stretch?
* How much potential energy is stored in the spring?

**Mass Dropping Onto Spring**: I position a mass of 10 kg above a spring with a spring constant of 4.5 N/m. I then drop the mass onto the spring and let it bounce back up. Ignore air resistance.
* What is the total initial energy of the system (before I drop the mass)?
* What is the total final energy of the system (when it reaches its maximum height after bouncing off the spring)?
* What is the maximum compression of the spring?
* How much force does the spring exert on the mass when it is fully compressed?
* What is the final height of the mass after it bounces off the spring?
* How would the compression change if I increased the starting height of the mass?
* How would the compression change if I increased the spring constant?
