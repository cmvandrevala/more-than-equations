## Practice

**Pushing a Merry-Go-Round**: I start pushing a merry-go-round with a torque of 10 Newton-meters.Â It has a moment of inertia ofÂ 100 $kg \cdot m^2$. Assume that it starts from rest.
* WhatÂ is its rotational speed after three seconds?
* What is its angular momentum after three seconds?

**Two Flywheels**: A flywheel rotates without friction at an angular velocityÂ $\omega_o$ = 600 revolutions per minuteÂ on a frictionless, vertical shaft of negligible rotational inertia. A second flywheel, which is at rest and has a moment of inertia three times that of the first rotating flywheel, is dropped onto it. Because friction exists between the surfaces, the flywheels very quickly reach the same rotational velocity, after which they spin together.
* Use the law of conservation of angular momentum to determine the final angular velocityÂ $\omega_f$Â of the combination. 
* What fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the coupling of the flywheels?

**Embedded Bullet**: A bullet of massÂ $m$ = 2.0 gramsÂ is moving horizontally with a speed ofÂ 500 m/s.Â The bullet strikes and becomes embedded in the edge of a solid disk of massÂ $M$ = 3.2 kgÂ and radiusÂ $R$ = 0.5m.Â The cylinder is free to rotate around its axis and is initially at rest. 
* What is the angular velocity of the disk immediately after the bullet is embedded?
* What is the total initial energy of the system?
* What is the total final energy of the system?

**Blob of Clay**: A blob of clay of massÂ 0.24 kgÂ is dropped on top of a rotating disk at a distance of 0.15 m from its axis of rotation and sticks onto it. The disk is spinning with an initial speed of 2 rad/sec and has a moment of inertia of 10 $kg \cdot m^2$.
* What will the final rotational speedÂ be?
* How would the final speed change if the mass of the clay blob increased?
* How would the final speed change if the moment of inertia of the disk increased?
* How would the final speed change if I dropped the clay blob closer to the center of the disk?
