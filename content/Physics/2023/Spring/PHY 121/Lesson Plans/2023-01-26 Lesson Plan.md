## Timeline

ðŸ“† Previous Lesson: [[2023-01-24 Lesson Plan]]
ðŸ“† Next Lesson: [[2023-01-31 Lesson Plan]]

## Topics

* Gravitational Force
* Friction Force
* Dependent vs. Independent Variables
* Data Collection in the Physics Lab

## Objectives

* Introduce friction into statics problems
* Gain familiarity with the equation for gravitational force
* Gain an understanding about how we might construct an experiment

## Sequence

* Announcements
* Talk about due date of pre-lab quiz vs lab writeup
* Answer questions about reading / homework
* Go through practice problems for friction and gravitational force
* Break
* Pre-lab discussion and assignment of dependent variables
* Pendulum lab (part 1)

## Time Management

I want to reserve 2 hours for the lab. The remaining class time will be spent on practice problems.

## Practice

**Pulling a Suitcase**: You are pulling a suitcase through the airport at a constant speed by exerting a force of 25.0 N at an angle of $30^\circ$ from the vertical. What is the force of friction acting on the suitcase?

**Field Strength Above the Earth**: The gravitational field strength at the surface of the Earth is 9.8 $m/s^2$.
* How far above the Earth would the field strength be $2/3$ the value at the surface?
* How far above the Earth would the field strength be $1/3$ the value at the surface?

**Eclipses**: Calculate the net gravitational force on the Moon from the Earth and Sun during a lunar eclipse (i.e. the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon). Do the same for a solar eclipse (i.e. the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun).

**Binary Star System**: A binary star system consists of two stars with masses $M$ and $4M$ that are a distance $d$ apart.
* Sketch a diagram of the system with arrows showing the direction of the gravitational field around the stars.
* Where would the gravitational field be equal to zero around these stars?

**Sliding Point**: A box with mass $M_{box}$ is sitting on a table with a coefficient of static friction $\mu$. I slowly start to tilt the table upwards. At what angle $\theta$ will the box start to slide?

**Framed Picture on a Wall**: While trying to decide where to hang a framed picture, you press it against the wall to keep it from falling. The picture weighs 5.0 N, and you press against the flat frame with a force of 6.0 N at an angle of $40^\circ$ from the vertical.
* What is the direction of the normal force exerted on the picture by your hand?
* What is the direction of the normal force exerted on the picture by the wall?
* What is the minimum coefficient of static friction between the wall and the picture?
* Depending on the magnitude of the force you exert, the frictional force exerted on the picture by the wall could have either of two possible directions. Why?
