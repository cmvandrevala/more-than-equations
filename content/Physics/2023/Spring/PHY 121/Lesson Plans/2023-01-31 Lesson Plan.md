**Plot of Friction Force**: A block with a mass of 15 kg is sitting on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction of the system is $\mu_s = 0.60$ and the coefficient of kinetic friction of the system is $\mu_k = 0.45$. I apply a horizontal force, $\vec{F}$, to the block which starts at zero Newtons and slowly increase its magnitude.
* Plot the friction force on the block as a function of $\vec{F}$
* Label the regions of the graph where the block is stationary and where the block is moving

**Pushing a Crate**: A crate with a mass of 30 kg is sitting on the floor of a warehouse. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is $\mu_k = 0.3$.
* Suppose I apply a horizontal force $\vec{F}$ to the crate so that it moves at a constant velocity. What is the magnitude of $\vec{F}$?
* Suppose I apply a force $\vec{F}$ at $30^\circ$ above the horizontal to the crate so that it moves at a constant velocity. What is the magnitude of $\vec{F}$?
* Suppose I apply a force $\vec{F}$ at $30^\circ$ below the horizontal to the crate so that it moves at a constant velocity. What is the magnitude of $\vec{F}$?

**Sliding Point**: A box with mass $M_{box}$ is sitting on a table with a coefficient of static friction $\mu$. I slowly start to tilt the table upwards. At what angle $\theta$ will the box start to slide?

**Framed Picture on a Wall**: While trying to decide where to hang a framed picture, you press it against the wall to keep it from falling. The picture weighs 5.0 N, and you press against the flat frame with a force of 6.0 N at an angle of $40^\circ$ from the vertical.
* What is the direction of the normal force exerted on the picture by your hand?
* What is the direction of the normal force exerted on the picture by the wall?
* What is the minimum coefficient of static friction between the wall and the picture?
* Depending on the magnitude of the force you exert, the frictional force exerted on the picture by the wall could have either of two possible directions. Why?

**Spring Scales and Pulleys**: Spring scale A is attached to the floor and a rope runs vertically upward, loops over an ideal pulley, and runs down on the other side to a 120 N object. Scale B is attached to the ceiling and the pulley is hung below it. What are the readings of the two spring scales A and B? Ignore the weights of the rope, pulley, and scales.

**Two Boxes on a Ramp**: Two boxes with different masses are tied together on a frictionless ramp surface. What is the tension in each of the cords?

**Box Hanging From Ideal Pulley**: An ideal pulley is hung from the ceiling by a rope. A block of mass $M$ is suspended by another rope that passes over the pulley and is attached to the wall. The rope fastened to the wall makes a right angle with the wall. Ignore the masses of the rope and pulley.
* Find the tension in the rope from which the pulley hangs
* Find the angle $\theta$ that the rope makes with the ceiling
