## Topics

* Free Body Diagrams
* Statics Problems

## Objectives

* Set up free-body diagrams for a variety of physical situations
* Analyze a class of problems called "statics" problems (without torque)

## Sequence

* Announcements
* Talk about lab one
* Answer questions about reading / homework
* Summarize the steps to solve a statics problem
* Work through statics problems as a class

## Time Management

* Answer Homework / Reading Questions: 15 - 30 minutes
* Statics Problems: Remainder of Class

## Practice

**Free Body Diagram Practice**: Draw a free-body diagram for each of the following situations:
* A ball falling due to the force of gravity
* A block sitting on a flat table
* A block sitting on a rough inclined plane with friction
* A block hanging from a string from the ceiling
* A pendulum at the lowest point in its swing
* A pendulum at the highest point in its swing

**Stacked Boxes**: Two boxes are stacked on the floor, one on top of the other. The top box has a mass of 10 kg and the bottom box has a mass of 25 kg. 
* What is the contact force between the boxes? 
* What is the contact force between the bottom box and the floor?

**Hanging Sign**: A sign for "Rick's Cafe Americain" is hung using a combination of a rope and a metal rod that is horizontal to the building. The sign weighs 300 N.
* Sketch a free-body diagram of the setup.
* What is the total tension in the rope (T)?
* What is the compressive force on the rod?

**Crow on a Rope**: A crow sits in the middle of a rope suspended between two poles. Each end of the rope makes an angle of $\theta$ below the horizontal due to the weight of the crow. The crow weighs 10 N.
* Sketch a free-body diagram of the setup.
* What is the total tension in the rope (T)?

**Hanging Picture**: You want to hang a 15 N picture from your wall. However, the twine that you are using will break if you apply more than 12 N of tension to it. 
* Can you hang the picture in configuration (a)? 
* Can you hang the picture in configuration (b)?

**Block Hanging From Cables**: A 25 kg block is hanging in the configuration shown in the diagram.
* Sketch a free body diagram of the setup
* What is the tension in rope segment AD?
* What is the tension in rope segment BD?
* What is the tension in rope segment CD?

**(Challenge) Ice Climber**: An ice climber is dangling from two ropes on an icy mountain as shown in the diagram. What is the tension in each rope?
