## Topics

We are probably not going to be able to cover every one of these topics today. We will get through as many as we can on Tuesday and then finish up on Thursday.

* Temperature scales
* Thermal expansion
* Internal energy
* Heat
* Specific heat
* Ideal gases
* Phase transitions

## Objectives

* Perform some basic calculations on the topics listed above

## Sequence

* Course surveys are now available
* What is temperature?
	* It is a quantity that determines when two objects are in thermal equilibrium.
	* Objects in thermal equilibrium might not have the same energy, but they will have the same temperature.
	* Temperature scales: C, F, K
		* $T_F = 1.8 T_C + 32$
		* $T_C = T_K - 273.15$
		* Usually, $T_K$ is just written as $T$
* Thermal expansion
	* Linear: $\Delta L = L_o \alpha \Delta T$
	* Area: $\Delta A = 2 A_o \alpha \Delta T$ (Note the factor of two for two dimensions)
	* Volume: $\Delta V = V_o \beta \Delta T$ ($\beta = 3\alpha$ for solids, not for liquids)
* Internal energy
	* The internal energy of a system is defined as the total energy of all of the molecules in the system, excluding the macroscopic kinetic energy and the external potential energy.
	* This internal energy comes from a variety of sources - movement of molecules, vibrations of the molecules, rotation of the molecules, etc.
	* Average translational kinetic energy: $\langle K \rangle = \frac{3}{2} k_B T$
	* Example 14.1 in the book
* Heat is energy in transit between two objects or systems due to a temperature difference
	* $Q = mc \Delta T$
* Total translational kinetic energy of an ideal gas containing N molecules: $K = \frac{3}{2} N k_B T$
	* Monatomic gas - single atom
	* Diatomic gas - two atoms
	* The specific heat of a diatomic gas is larger than that of a monatomic gas because diatomic gases can rotate whereas monatomic gases cannot - talk about symmetries of a sphere ðŸ˜„

## Practice

**Quick Calculations**: Perform the following calculations involving temperature and thermal expansion:
* On a warm summer day, the air temperature is $84^\circ F$. What is this temperature in degrees Centigrade?
* Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K. What is this temperature in degrees Farenheit?
* A thin copper wire has a coefficient of thermal expansion of $17 \times 10^{-6} K^{-1}$. How would the length of a 10 cm strip of the wire change if it increased from room temperature ($20^\circ$ C) to $30^\circ$ C?

**Lead and Gas Rod**: A lead rod and a glass rod both have the same length when they are at room temperature ($20^\circ$ C). The lead rod is heated to $50^\circ C$. To what temperature must the glass rod be heated so that they are the same length again?

```ad-info
$\alpha_{glass} = 3.25 \times 10^{-6} K^{-1}$

$\alpha_{lead} = 29 \times 10^{-6} K^{-1}$
```

**Victoria Falls**: Water passing over Victoria Falls, located along the Zambezi River on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia, drops about 105 meters. How much internal energy is produced per kilogram as a result of the fall?

**Lead Bullet Stopped by Plate**: How much internal energy is generated when a 20 g lead bullet, traveling at 700 m/s comes to a stop as it strikes a metal plate?

**Heated Water**: If 125.6 kJ of heat are supplied to 500 grams of water at $22^\circ C$, what is the final temperature of the water?

```ad-info
$c_{water}$ = $4184$ $J$ $kg^{-1} K^{-1}$
```

**Aluminum Tea Kettle**: An aluminum tea kettle contains 2.0 kg of water at $15^\circ$ C. How much heat is required to raise the temperature of the water from room temperature ($20^\circ$ C) to boiling temperature ($100^\circ$ C)?

**Ice and Water**: Ice at $0.0^\circ C$ is mixed with 500 mL of water at $25^\circ C$. The final temperature of the system is $10^\circ C$. How much ice was added to the water?
