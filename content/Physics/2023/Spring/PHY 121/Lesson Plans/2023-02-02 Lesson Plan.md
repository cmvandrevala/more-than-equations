## Timeline

ðŸ“† Previous Lesson: [[2023-01-31 Lesson Plan]]
ðŸ“† Next Lesson: [[2023-02-07 Lesson Plan]]

## Topics

* Newton's Law of Gravitation
* Uncertainty and Errors

## Objectives

* Use Newton's Law of Gravitation to determine the gravitational field around a massive body
* Discuss and quantify the different types of errors that arise during an experiment

## Sequence

* Introduce Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
* Continue pendulum lab
	* Select three data sets from pendulum one lab (you choose which three you want to do)
	* What are sources of systematic (one-sided) errors from last week?
	* What are sources of random (two-sided) errors from last week?
	* Make measurements to quantify errors.

## Practice

**Field Strength Above the Earth**: The gravitational field strength at the surface of the Earth is 9.8 $m/s^2$.
* How far above the Earth would the field strength be $2/3$ the value at the surface?
* How far above the Earth would the field strength be $1/3$ the value at the surface?

**Eclipses**: Calculate the net gravitational force on the Moon from the Earth and Sun during a lunar eclipse (i.e. the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon). Do the same for a solar eclipse (i.e. the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun).

**Binary Star System**: A binary star system consists of two stars with masses $M$ and $4M$ that are a distance $d$ apart.
* Sketch a diagram of the system with arrows showing the direction of the gravitational field around the stars.
* Where would the gravitational field be equal to zero around these stars?
