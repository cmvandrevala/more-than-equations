## Topics

* Discuss How / When to Merge Data in Lab
* Translational vs. Rotational Motion
	* Assumption: The Origin is at the Center of Mass in Our FBDs
	* Every Problem We Have Done Could Be Considered Rotation By Changing the Origin
* Review of Radians
* Translation to Rotation Analogs
	* Position / Displacement $\rightarrow$ Angular Position / Displacement
	* Velocity $\rightarrow$ Angular Velocity
	* Acceleration $\rightarrow$ Angular Acceleration
	* Force $\rightarrow$ Torque
	* Mass $\rightarrow$ Moment of Inertia (We Won't Talk About That Until Chapter 8)
* Centripetal Force and Acceleration
* Uniform Circular Motion

## Objectives

* Determine when you should or should not merge two data sets, based on their control variables
* Qualitatively discuss angular motion / velocity / acceleration concepts
* Calculate centripetal force and acceleration for a rotating rigid body
* Calculate the properties of a body in uniform circular motion

## Sequence

* Discuss Merging Datasets From Lab
* Introduce Rotational Motion
* Rotation / Uniform Circular Motion Examples

## Practice

**Rolling Wheel**: A wheel with a diameter of 0.75 meters is rolling without slipping along the floor. It is moving with a translational velocity of 5.0 m/s.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the rolling wheel.
* How long does it take for the wheel to make one complete turn?
* Would it take more or less time for the wheel to make one complete turn if I increase the diameter of the wheel?
* Would it take more or less time for the wheel to make one complete turn if I increase the translational velocity of the wheel?
* Would static or kinetic friction come into play while the wheel rolls without slipping?
* Bonus: Use your answer to the previous question to explain why anti-lock breaking systems allow your car wheels to turn sporadically while breaking. Hint: generally, the coefficient of static friction is larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction between two surfaces. 

**Puck on a Table**: A puck with a mass of 0.5 kg is tied to a string of length 20 cm, which is in turn tied to a pin on a frictionless table. The puck is pushed so that it undergoes uniform circular motion with an angular speed of 20 rad/sec.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the puck on the table.
* Which of the forces acting on the puck provide the centripetal force?
* What is the centripetal force acting on the puck?
* What is the centripetal acceleration acting on the puck?
* How would the tension in the string change if I increased the speed of the puck?
* How would the tension in the string change if I increased the mass of the puck?

**Car on a Circular Road**: An 850 kg car moving at 20 m/s traverses a circular road with a radius of 70.0 m without slipping.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the car.
* Which of the forces acting on the car provide the centripetal force?
* What is the net force acting on the car?
* What is the net acceleration acting on the car?
* Which direction is the force / acceleration pointing?
* What is the minimum coefficient of friction between the road and the car?

**Car on a Banked Circular Road**: An 850 kg car traverses a circular road with a radius of 70.0 m. The road is wet with rain (no friction), but it is banked at an angle of $15^\circ$.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the car.
* Which of the forces acting on the car provide the centripetal force?
* What is the net force acting on the car?
* What is the net acceleration acting on the car?
* Which direction is the force / acceleration pointing?
* At what speed can the car safely traverse the curve without slipping / drifting?
* What would happen if the car increases its speed while traversing the curve?
* What would happen if the car decreases its speed while traversing the curve?

**Orbiting Bodies**: A satellite of mass $m$ orbits a planet of mass $M$ at a distance of $R$ from the center of the planet.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the satellite in orbit
* Which of the forces acting on the satellite provide the centripetal force?
* What is the centripetal force acting on the satellite?
* What is the centripetal acceleration acting on the satellite?
* At what speed does the satellite orbit the planet?
* What would happen if the satellite were to increase its speed?
* What would happen if the satellite were to decrease its speed?
* The ISS orbits Earth at a altitude of 420 km above the surface. What is the average speed of the ISS according to Newton's Laws / centripetal acceleration?

Mass of Earth: $5.97219 \times 10^{24}$Â kg
Radius of Earth: 6378.1 km
Gravitational Constant (G): $6.6743 \times 10^{-11} N \cdot m^2/kg^2$

> The ISS travels at about 17,500 miles/28,000 kilometers per hour. At this speed, the ISS orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, which gives the crew 16 sunrises and sunsets every day.
