## Timeline

ðŸ“† Previous Lesson: [[2023-03-23 Lesson Plan]]

## Topics

* Fluids
* Pressure
* Density
* Pascal's Principal
* Archimedes Principal
* Bernoulli's Law

## Objectives

* Analyze a variety of physics problems involving fluids

## Sequence

* Definitely read this chapter!
	* They do a great job relating fluids to work / momentum / forces.
* Pro-Tip - Pay Attention to Units Since They Can Help You "Guess" the Answer
* Car and Piston Example (Page 116)
	* Pressure on each piston is $P = F/A \Rightarrow F = PA$
	* Change in volume of the fluid is $\Delta V = dA$ 
	* Work is $W = Fd = F \Delta V / A = P \Delta V$
	* Does this look familiar?
* Practice Problems

## Practice

**Some Quick Calculations**: Answer the following questions, just to get warmed up.
* A nurse applies a force of 4.40 N to the piston of a syringe. The piston has an area of $5.00 \times 10^{-5}$  $m^2$. What is the pressure increase in the fluid within the syringe?
* At the surface of a lake, the air pressure is 1 atmosphere. What is the pressure on a fish at a depth of 5 meters deep?
* A density of platinum is 21,500 $kg/m^3$. What is the mass of a 1 $cm^3$ cube of platinum.

**Hydraulic Lift**: In a hydraulic lift, the radii of the pistons are 2.50 cm and 10.0 cm. A car weighing 10.0 kN is lifted by the force of the large piston.
* What minimum force must be applied to the small piston to lift the car?
* When the small piston is pushed in by 10.0 cm, how far is the car lifted?
* What is the work done by lifting the car?

**Floating Block of Wood**: A block of wood floats in oil with 90% of its volume submerged. What is the density of the oil if the density of the wood is 0.67 $g/cm^3$?

**Barge**: A flat-bottomed barge is loaded with coal and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^5$ kg. It is 20.0 m long and 10.0 m wide. What is the depth of the barge below the waterline?

**Garden Hose**: A garden hose with a radius of 1.0 cm carries water at 2.0 m/s. The nozzle at the end of the hose has a radius of 0.20 cm. How fast does the water exit the nozzle?

**Blood Flow in an Aorta**: The average volume flow of blood through the aorta is $8.5 \times 10^{-5}$  $m^3/s$ and its cross-sectional area is $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$  $m^2$. What is the average speed of blood in the aorta?

**Horizontal Segment of Pipe**: A horizontal segment of pipe tapers from a cross-sectional area of 50.0 $cm^2$ to 0.50 $cm^2$. The pressure at the larger end of the pipe is $1.20 \times 10^5$ Pa and the speed is 0.05 m/s. What is the pressure at the narrow end of the pipe?

**Tank With a Leak**:  Suppose that a huge tank 50 mÂ high and filled with water is open to the atmosphere. It springs a leak, allowing water to flow out. The hole is 2 mÂ above the ground. If the hole is very small in comparison with the size of the tank, how quickly will the water flow out of the tank?
