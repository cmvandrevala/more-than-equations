## Practice

**Escape Speed**: What is the escape speed of the Earth?

**Mass Hanging From a Spring**: A mass $M$ is hanging from a spring with a spring constant $k$. The mass is at rest.
* Draw a free-body diagram of the setup
* How much does the spring stretch?
* How much potential energy is stored in the spring at equilibrium?

**Mass Dropped Onto Spring**: I position a mass of 10 kg above a spring with a spring constant of 450 N/m. I then drop the mass onto the spring and let it bounce back up. Ignore air resistance.
* What is the total energy of the system before I drop the mass?
* What is the total energy of the system when the mass reaches its maximum height after bouncing off the spring?
* What is the maximum compression of the spring?
* How much force does the spring exert on the mass when it is fully compressed?
* What is the final height of the mass after it bounces off the spring?
* How would the compression change if I increased the starting height of the mass?
* How would the compression change if I increased the spring constant?

**Comparing Energy and Momentum**: Consider a particle with a mass of 8 kg. 
* If it has a kinetic energy of 400 J, what is its momentum?
* If it has a momentum of 30 $kg \cdot m/s$, what is its kinetic energy?

**Falling Object**: An object of mass 3.0 kg falls from rest from a height of 10 meters.
* Calculate the change in momentum using the kinematics equations and the given mass
* Calculate the change in momentum using the conservation of energy and the given mass
* Calculate the change in momentum using the impulse-momentum theorem

**Stopping an Automobile**: An automobile traveling at a speed of 30.0 m/s applies its brakes and comes to a stop in five seconds. If the automobile has a mass of 1000 kg, what is the average horizontal force exerted on it during braking?

**Pulling a Sled**: What average force is necessary to bring a 50 kg sled from rest to a speed of 3.0 m/s in a period of 20.0 seconds? You can assume it is moving along frictionless ice.

**Firing a Torpedo from a Submarine**: A submarine of mass $2.5 \times 10^6$ kg is initially at rest. It fires a torpedo of mass 250 kg forward with an initial speed of 100.0 m/s. What is the recoil speed of the submarine?

**Nuclear Decay**: A uranium nucleus of mass 238 u is initially at rest. It undergoes radioactive decay, breaking up into an alpha particle (4 u) and a thorium nucleus (234 u). If the alpha particle moves away from the nucleus at 0.05 times the speed of light, what is the recoil speed of the thorium nucleus?

```ad-info
title: Useful Information

Speed of Light (c): $3 \times 10^8$ m/s

1 u is $1.66 \times 10^{-27}$ kg
```

**Cannon**:  A cannon on a railroad car fires a 98 kg shell at a speed of 105 m/s and angle of $60^\circ$ with respect to the horizontal. If the cannon and railcar have a combined mass of $5.4 \times 10^4$ kg, what is the recoil speed of the car? The railroad car is initially at rest.
