## Practice

**Falling Rock**: A rock falls from a height of 2 meters off the ground. What is its speed right before it hits the Earth?
* Calculate its final speed using the kinematics equations
* Calculate its final speed using the work-kinetic energy theorem
* Calculate its final speed using conservation of mechanical energy

**Oscillations of a Pendulum**: A pendulum is hung from the ceiling from a string of length 10 meters. I start the pendulum at an angle of $5^\circ$ from its resting point.
* What is the maximum gravitational potential energy of the pendulum?
* What is the maximum kinetic energy of the pendulum?
* Plot the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum as a function of time
* Plot the kinetic energy of the pendulum as a function of time
