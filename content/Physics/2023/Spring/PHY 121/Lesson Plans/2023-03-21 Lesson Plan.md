## Practice

### Momentum

**Exploding Firework**: A firework explodes and forms three fragments of equal mass. One fragment travels directly upward at 14 m/s and the second fragment moves at 25 m/s at $25^\circ$ below the horizontal to the right. Determine the velocity of the third fragment immediately after the explosion.

**Inelastic Collision**: A 2.0 kg object is at rest on a frictionless surface when it is hit by a 3.0 kg object moving at 8.0 m/s. The two objects stick together after they collide.
* What is the speed of the combination after the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?
* Why are the energies different? Have we violated conservation of energy?

**Elastic Collision**: Two billiard balls, each with a mass of 0.20 kg, collide. Ball one moves with an initial velocity of 6 m/s, and ball two is initially at rest. After the collision, ball one comes to a complete stop. 
* What is the velocity of ball two after the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?

**Collision in Two Dimensions**: Two objects slide over a frictionless horizontal surface. The first object, massÂ $m_1$ = 5 kg, is propelled with speedÂ $v_{i1} = 4.5 {\rm m/s}$Â toward the second object, massÂ $m_2$ = 2.5 kg, which is initially at rest. After the collision, both objects have velocities which are directedÂ $\theta = 30^\circ$Â on either side of the original line of motion of the first object.
* What are the final velocities of the two objects? 
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination before the collision?
* What is the total kinetic energy of the combination after the collision?
* Is the collision elastic or inelastic?

### Center of Mass

**Center of Mass With Two Masses**: A point mass $m_1 = 45 kg$ is located at the point (0.5 m, 0.6 m). A second point mass $m_2 = 10 kg$ is located at the point (1.0 m, -4.3 m). What is the center of mass of the system?

**Center of Mass With Three Masses**: A point mass $m_1 = 5 kg$ is located at the point (0.25 m, 0.25 m, 0.25 m). A second point mass $m_2 = 6 kg$ is located at the point (1.7 m, -1.2 m, 0.1 m). A third point mass $m_3 = 2 kg$ is located at the point (1.1 m, -2.5 m, -3.7 m). What is the center of mass of the system?

### Statics

**Torque on a Wire**: A wire is pinned to a table at the red point. What is the net torque on the wire?

**Torque Balance**: Three masses are attached to a uniform meter stick, as shown inÂ the figure. The mass of the meter stick is $150.0 g$. The masses to the left of the fulcrum areÂ $m_1 = 50.0 g$ and $m_2 = 60.0g$.
* Find the massÂ $m_3$Â that balances the system when it is attached at the right end of the stick.
* Find the normal reaction force at the fulcrum when the system is balanced.
