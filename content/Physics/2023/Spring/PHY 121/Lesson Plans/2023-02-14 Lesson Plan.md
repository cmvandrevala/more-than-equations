## Timeline

ðŸ“† Previous Lesson: [[2023-02-09 Lesson Plan]]
ðŸ“† Next Lesson: [[2023-02-23 Lesson Plan]]

## Topics

* Pendulum Lab Wrap-Up
* Kinematics in One and Two Dimensions

## Objectives

* Determine the units on a variety of mathematical models
* Discuss how we might deal with uncertainty in our data and mathematical models in the lab
* Complete a variety of kinematics problems in one and two dimensions

## Sequence

* Discuss pendulum lab
	* I did not grade the calculation of the units since we did not discuss that in class before the lab.
	* Why did people have different curves, given the same data?
	* How might we handle the situation where the theoretical model is in SI units and our data is not?
	* How do we determine which mathematical model is correct?
	* What is the difference between precision and accuracy of measurements?
* Discuss exam
	* Exam format is numerical problems and short answer questions
	* Exam corrections are due the Sunday of the following week
* Kinematics practice
	* Algorithm:
		* Draw a diagram (free body diagram?)
		* Draw a coordinate axis
		* List known values
		* Break up problem by dimension
		* Solve for unknowns

## Practice

### One Dimensional

**Dropping a Pebble**: A student drops a pebble from the edge of a vertical cliff. The pebble hits the ground four seconds after it was dropped. What is the height of the cliff?

**Kangaroo**: A kangaroo is capable of jumping to a vertical height of 2.62 m. Determine the takeoff speed of the kangaroo.

**Acceleration of a Dragster**: A dragster accelerates to a speed of 112 m/s over a distance of 398 m. Determine the acceleration (assume uniform) of the dragster.

**Velocity of a Bike**: A bike is traveling at a velocity of 4 m/s to the north. The biker accelerates with an acceleration of 0.1 $m/s^2$ to the south for five seconds. What is the final velocity of the bike?

**Top Speed of a Sloth**: A three-toed sloth can achieve a top speed of 0.17 mph (0.076 m/s). If we assume that a sloth can achieve this speed in 3 seconds, what is the acceleration of the sloth?

### Two Dimensional

**Firing an Arrow**: An arrow is shot from a bow and arrow with an initial speed v = 10 m/s at an angle of $30^\circ$ above the ground.
* What is the time of flight?
* What is the horizontal distance covered?
* What is the maximum height?
* What is the angle at which it hits the ground?

**Throwing a Ball Off a Cliff**: A ball is thrown with an initial speed v = 10 m/s at an angle of $30^\circ$ off a cliff that is 20 meters above the ground.
* What is the time of flight?
* What is the horizontal distance covered?
* What is the maximum height?
* What is the angle at which it hits the ground?

**Projectile Fired From a Cannon**: A cannonball is fired from a cannon located and flies in an arc towards a target that is 75 meters away. After five seconds of flight, it hits the target.
* What is the maximum height?
* What is the initial velocity of the launch?
* What is the angle of launch?
* What is the angle at which it hits the ground?

### Three Dimensional

**Frisbee in the Wind**: A frolfer throws a 0.5 kg disc towards a goal with an initial velocity of (3 m/s, 3 m/s, 2 m/s). The disc flies towards the goal, acted on by the force of gravity and a force from the wind, which is (2 N, -2 N, -1 N).
* How long does the disc stay in the air?
* What is the final position of the disc after it hits the ground?
