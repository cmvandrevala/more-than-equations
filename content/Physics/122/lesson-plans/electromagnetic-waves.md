## üìã Sequence

* General properties of waves
  * Sinusoidal oscillations
  * Frequency and period
  * Angular frequency and wave number
  * Amplitude
  * \\( v = f \\lambda \\)
  * Transverse versus longitudinal waves
* Properties of electromagnetic waves
  * The amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields are related by \\( E = cB \\)
  * EM waves are transverse waves
  * Electric and magnetic fields travel at the speed of light
  * Yet another RHR! You can figure out the direction of propagation using a RHR.
* Speed of light in a medium
  * Speed of light in a vacuum is constant - \\( 3 \\times 10^8 \\: m/s \\)
  * The index of refraction is defined as \\( n = c / v \\) or \\( v = c / n \\)
  * Frequency does not change as you move from one medium to another
  * Wavelength does change: \\( c / n = f \\lambda_{new} \\Rightarrow \\lambda_{new} = \\lambda / n \\)
  * Index of refraction is usually a function of frequency, leading to dispersion
