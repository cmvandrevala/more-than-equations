## üìã Sequence

We will be going through a variety of practice problems to showcase Faraday's law of induction and Lenz's law. Specifically, we will cover the cases of changing magnetic field, changing wire loop area, and changing wire loop angle.

## üìù Practice Problems

1. Calculate the EMF across the ends of a rod of length L moving at a speed v in a magnetic field B.
2. Calculate the EMF in a loop of wire that is immersed in a changing magnetic field.
3. Calculate the EMF in a loop of wire that is changing in size and is immersed in a constant magnetic field.
4. Calculate the EMF in a loop of wire that is turning in a magnetic field.

## ‚úÖ Partial Solutions

We are going to go over each practice problem together in class.
