## üìù Practice Problems

1. What is the difference between an electric field and an electric force?

1. A point charge of $$q = -12 \: \mu C$$ is immersed in an electric field of $$\vec{E} = 1000 \hat{y} \: N/C$$. What is the magnitude and direction of the force that it will feel?

1. A charge of 10 $$\mu C$$ is positioned at the origin while another charge of -30 $$\mu C$$ is positioned at the point (5 cm, 0 cm). Where around the two points (if anywhere) is the net electric force on a positive point charge equal to zero?

1. A particle with a mass of 1.1 kg and a charge of 0.5 mC starts from rest at the origin. I switch on a uniform electric field of $$\vec{E} = 10.7 \hat{x} \: N/C$$ at time $$t = 0 \: s$$. At what position will we find the particle after 5 seconds?
