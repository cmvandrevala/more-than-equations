## üìù Practice Problems

1. The index of water is 1.33. What is the speed of light in water? What is the wavelength of light in water if it has a vacuum wavelength of 515 nm?
2. Unpolarized light is incident on a system of three ideal polarizers. The second polarizer is oriented at an angle of \\( 30^\circ \\) with respect to the first, and the third is oriented with an angle of \\( 45^\circ \\) with respect to the first. If light exits the system of polarizers with an intensity of \\( 23 \\: W/m^2 \\), what is the intensity of the incident light?
3. Two plane mirrors form a \\( 70^\circ \\) angle as shown in the diagram. For what angle \\( \theta \\) will the outgoing ray be horizontal?

4. A ray of light strikes an air / water interface at an angle of \\( 25^\circ \\) with respect to the vertical. At what angle, with respect to the vertical, will the light move through the water? The index of refraction of water is 1.33.
5. A glass lens has a scratch-resistant plastic coating on it. The speed of light in the glass is 0.67c and the speed of light in the coating is 0.80c. A ray of light in the coating is incident on the plastic-glass boundary at an angle of \\( 12^\circ \\) with respect to the normal. At what angle with respect to the normal is the ray transmitted into the glass?
6. Calculate the critical angle for sapphire surrounded by air. The index of refraction for sapphire is 1.76.
7. A defect in diamond appears to be 2.0 mm below the surface. If the index of refraction of diamond is 2.42, how far below the surface is the defect actually located?
8. Why does a diamond sparkle less under water than in air?
