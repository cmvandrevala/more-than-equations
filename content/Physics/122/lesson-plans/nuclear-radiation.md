## üìã Sequence

* Set the stage: Two blobs fly towards each other at relativistic speed and stick together. What is the change in mass of the blobs?
* Vocabulary
  * Nucleon - a particle that is found in the nucleus of an atom (i.e. a proton or a neutron)
  * Nucleon number (A) - the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus, also called the mass number
  * Atomic number (Z) - the number of protons in an atom
  * Isotope - an atom with a specific number of protons, but different masses due to different numbers of neutrons
  * Atomic mass unit - 1/12 the mass of a neutral \\( ^{12}C \\) atom. \\(1 \\: u = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \\: kg \\). Nucleons have a mass approximately equal to 1 u.
* Radius of a nucleus:
  * \\( r = r_o A^{1/3} \\) where \\(r_o \approx 1.2 \:fm \\)
* Coulomb force between two protons:
  * \\( F = kq^2/r^2 = (9e9)(1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2/(1 \times 10^{-15})^2 \approx 230 \\: N \\)
  * \\( F = ma \Rightarrow a = (230 \\: N)/(1.67 \times 10^{-27} \\: kg) = 1.38 \times 10^{29} \\: m/s^2 \\)
  * Why doesn't the universe just explode and everything die?
* Strong force
  * There is a very short range force that holds nucleons together
  * Comparison of strong force to electromagnetism / gravity
  * Where does the strong force come from?
* The mass deficit
  * The mass of Z protons and N neutrons is not equal to the measured mass of a nucleus
  * Example problem: What is the binding energy of the \\( ^{14}N \\) nucleus?
* The binding energy curve
* How nuclei become more stable?
  * Disintegration energy - the amount of rest energy that gets turned into other forms of energy
  * Alpha decay
  * Beta decay
  * Electron capture
  * Gamma decay
  * Other modes

## üìù Practice Problems

1. What is the binding energy of deuteron ($$^2H$$). The mass of a deuteron nucleus is 2.013553 u. Hint: it is helpful to do the calculation in terms of atomic mass units instead of kilograms. Then, you can convert units using  $$1 \: u c^2 = 931.494 \: MeV$$
2. Radon-222 is a radioactive gas that can sometimes be produced by the alpha decay of a parent nuclide. What is the parent nuclide?
3. Write out the reaction when sodium-22 decays by electron capture. Hint: don't forget the neutrino!
4. Write out the reaction when sodium-22 decays by emitting a positron. Hint: don't forget the neutrino!
