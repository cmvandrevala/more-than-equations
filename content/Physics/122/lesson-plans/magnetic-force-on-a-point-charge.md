## üìù Practice Problems

1. An ion with a charge of +2.5 mC and an unknown mass moves in a circle of radius 12.5 cm when inside a magnetic field of 1.2 T. If the speed of the ion is 100 m/s, what is the mass of the ion?
2. A uniform magnetic field points vertically upward with a strength of 0.5 T. An electron with kinetic energy \\( 2.5 \times 10^{-18} \\: J \\) is moving horizontally in this field. What is the magnetic force acting on the electron? The mass of an electron is \\( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \\: kg \\) and the charge on an electron is \\( 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \\: C \\).
3. A particle with a charge of 0.5 mC is moving with a velocity of 25 m/s in the \\( +\\hat{x} \\) direction. If the magnetic field around the particle is 20 mT in the \\( -\\hat{y} \\) direction, what is the magnetic force on the particle (magnitude and direction)?
4. A particle with a charge of -1.7 mC is moving with a velocity of 32 m/s in the \\( -\\hat{z} \\) direction. If the magnetic field around the particle is 5 mT in the \\( +\\hat{y} \\) direction, what is the magnetic force on the particle (magnitude and direction)?
