## üìù Practice Problems

### Resistors

1. A resistor with a resistance of \\( R = 250 \\: \Omega \\) is connected to a 9 volt battery. What is the current drawn from the battery? What is the power dissipated across the resistor?
2. Four resistors, each with a resistance of \\( 10 \\: \Omega \\) are connected in series along a voltage source of \\( V = 25 \\: V \\). What is the power dissipated in each resistor? What is the total power dissipated in the circuit?
3. Four resistors, each with a resistance of \\( 10 \\: \Omega \\) are connected in parallel along a voltage source of \\( V = 25 \\: V \\). What is the power dissipated in each resistor? What is the total power dissipated in the circuit?
4. What is the equivalent resistance between nodes (a) and (d) in the diagram below? You can assume that each resistor is \\( R = 1 \\: \Omega \\).
