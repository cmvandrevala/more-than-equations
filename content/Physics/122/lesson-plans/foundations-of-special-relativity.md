title: Foundations of Special Relativity
topics:
  - Speed of light
  - Galilean relativity
  - Principle of relativity
  - Background for special relativity
  - Correspondence principle
objectives:
  - Describe the idea behind Galilean relativity and calculate relative speeds in different reference frames.
  - Talk about why Galilean relativity breaks down when one considers the speed of light.
  - Talk about how the assumptions of special relativity are different than those of Galilean relativity.
  - Describe the Correspondence principle and how it links classical relativity with special relativity.

## üìã Sequence

* Galilean relativity: $$\vec{v}_{AC} = \vec{v}_{AB} + \vec{v}_{BC}$$
* Constant speed of light in a vacuum
* The Michelson ‚Äì Morley experiment
* The Principle of Relativity - the laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame
* New assumptions for special relativity
* Special relativity is not the same as general relativity
  * No gravitational fields
  * No "weird" objects like black holes
  * We will not consider accelerating frames in this class
