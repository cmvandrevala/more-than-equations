1. A particle with a charge of 0.5 mC is moving with a velocity of 25 m/s in the \\( +\\hat{x} \\) direction. If the magnetic field around the particle is 20 mT in the \\( -\\hat{y} \\) direction, what is the direction of the magnetic force on the particle?
2. A particle with a charge of -1.7 mC is moving with a velocity of 32 m/s in the \\( -\\hat{z} \\) direction. If the magnetic field around the particle is 5 mT in the \\( +\\hat{y} \\) direction, what is the direction of the magnetic force on the particle?
