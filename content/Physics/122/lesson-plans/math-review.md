### Vectors Practice

1. Perform the following calculations. Then, sketch the initial and final vectors:

    $$
    2 \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \: ?
    $$

    $$
    -2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \: ?
    $$

    $$
    \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -3 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix} = \: ?
    $$

    $$
    (3\hat{x} + 6\hat{y}) - (4\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}) = \: ?
    $$

    $$
    (2\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + 2\hat{k}) - (7\hat{i} - 2\hat{j} + 3\hat{k}) = \: ?
    $$

1. A vector, $$\vec{A}$$ points in the $$+\hat{x}$$ direction. Draw three choices for a vector, $$\vec{B}$$, such that $$\vec{A} + \vec{B}$$ points in the $$+\vec{y}$$ direction.

1. Two vectors are given by $$\vec{A} = 3\hat{x} + 7\hat{y}$$ and $$\vec{B} = 4\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}$$.

    * Calculate the dot product of these vectors.
    * Calculate the angle between the two original vectors.
    * Sketch out the two original vectors and their dot product.

1. Two vectors are given by $$\vec{A} = -2\hat{x} + 6\hat{y} - 4\hat{z}$$ and $$\vec{B} = 2\hat{x} + 2\hat{y} - 3\hat{z}$$.

    * Calculate the cross product of these vectors.
    * Sketch out the two original vectors and their cross product

1. Consider the vector $$\vec{A} = 5 \hat{x} - 2\hat{y}$$.

    * What is its magnitude?
    * What is its direction (i.e. angle, measured from the positive x-axis)?
    * Write the formula for a unit vector pointing in the same direction as $$\vec{A}$$.

1. A sled at rest is suddenly pulled in three different directions at the same time, but it goes nowhere. Paul pulls to the northeast with a force of 50 lb. Johnny pulls at an angle of $$45^\circ$$ south of due west with a force of 65 lb. Connie pulls with a force to be determined.

    * Sketch a diagram of the system.
    * Express the boys‚Äô two forces in terms of $$\hat{x}$$, $$\hat{y}$$, and $$\hat{z}$$.
    * Determine the third force (from Connie).

### Trigonometry Practice

1. A vector has a magnitude of 30 Newtons and a direction of $$12^\circ$$, counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. Write this vector as a column vector.

2. Convert $$25^\circ$$ to radians.

3. A zip wire runs between two posts which are 25 meters¬†apart. The zip wire is at an angle of $$10^\circ$$ with respect to the horizontal. Calculate the length of the zip wire.

4. Express $$tan(\theta)$$ in terms of $$sin(\theta)$$ and $$cos(\theta)$$.

### Fields Practice

1. Sketch the gravitational field around the planet Earth when you are zoomed out on a planetary scale.
2. Sketch the approximate gravitational field near the surface of the Earth (this is the assumption we made for most of PHY 121).
