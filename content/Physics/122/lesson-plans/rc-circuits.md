## 📝 Practice Problems

1. A capacitor of \\( 0.10 \\: \mu F\\) is charged to 90 V and then connected to a \\( 30 \\: k \\Omega \\) resistor. What will the voltage across the resistor be after 8.4 ms?
2. A capacitor of \\( 0.050 \\: \\mu F \\) is initially uncharged and connected in series to a 12 V battery and a \\( 40 \\: k \\Omega \\) resistor. What is the current in the circuit at time t = 0 seconds? What is the current in the circuit at time t = 1 second?
3. In a charging RC circuit, how many time constants have elapsed when the capacitor has 99% of its final charge?
