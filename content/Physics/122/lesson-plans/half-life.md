## 📋 Sequence

* 1 becquerel (Bq) is the unit of one decay per second
* We could, theoretically, use $$R(t) = R_o e^{-t/\tau}$$ to characterize nuclear decay
* We instead use half life $$N(t) = N_o (1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$$

## 🖥️ Animations, Simulations, Activities

N/A

## 📝 Practice Problems

1. Manganese-54 has a half-life of 312 days. What fraction of nuclei in a sample of Mn-54 decay during a period of 936 days?

## ✅ Partial Solutions

1. 7/8 of them decay, 1/8 remains
