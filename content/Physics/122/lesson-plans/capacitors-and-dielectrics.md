### Dielectric Breakdown With the Van de Graaff Generator

Capacitance is a function of geometry. For a conducting sphere (like the dome of the Van de Graaff generator), the capacitance is given by: \\( C = 4 \pi \epsilon_o R \\) where \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere. If the dielectric breakdown of air is estimated to be 3 MV / m, estimate the charge stored on the Van de Graaff generator.

According to the Winsco docs, the diameter of the dome is 25 cm and can develop potentials up to 350,000 V.

## üìù Practice Problems

1. A parallel plate capacitor with a total plate area of \\( 0.25 m^2 \\) and a plate separation of 0.5 mm is connected to a 12 V battery. How much charge is stored on the capacitor?

2. Suppose I insert a dielectric material into the capacitor in problem one with a dielectric constant of \\( \kappa = 150 \\). How much charge is stored on the capacitor?
