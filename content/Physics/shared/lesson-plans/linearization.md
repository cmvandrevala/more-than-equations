title: Linearization
topics:
  - Linearization of polynomials
  - Linearization of exponentials
  - Linearization of logarithms
objectives:
  - Describe some of the types of mathematical models
  - Discuss why linearization is useful, even when we are able to get equations of best fit that are non-linear
  - Transform polynomial datasets so that they are linearized
  - Transform exponential datasets so that they are linearized
  - Transform logarithmic datasets so that they are linearized
