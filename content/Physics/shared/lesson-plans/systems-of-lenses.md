## üìù Practice Problems

1. An object is placed 12 cm in front of a lens with a focal length of 5.0 cm. Another lens of focal length 4.0 cm is placed 2.0 cm past the first lens.
    * Where is the final image located?
    * Is it real or virtual?
    * What is its overall magnification?
2. An object is located 16 cm in front of a converging lens with a focal length of 12 cm. To the right of the converging lens, separated by a distance of 20 cm, is a diverging lens of focal length -10 cm. Find the location of the final image.

## ‚úÖ Partial Solutions

1. 2.5 cm past the 4.0 cm lens, Real, -0.27
2. 15.6 cm to the left of the diverging lens
