title: Slits and Gratings
topics:
  - Single slit apparatus
  - Double slit apparatus
  - Diffraction gratings
  - Small angle approximation
objectives:
  - Describe the origin of interference effects in slits and gratings
  - Calculate the positions of maxima and minima in the single slit apparatus
  - Calculate the positions of maxima and minima in the double slit apparatus
  - Calculate the positions of maxima and minima in diffraction gratings
  - Describe the cumulative effects of a double slit apparatus where the slits are given non-zero width.
  - Use the small angle approximation to calculate the spacing between maxima or minima, wherever appropriate

## üìã Sequence

* Constructive versus destructive interference
* Wave interference
* Double slit apparatus
  * Maxima: $$d sin\theta = m\lambda$$ where $$m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$$
  * Minima: $$d sin\theta = (m - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$ where $$m = \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$$
* Diffraction grating
  * Maxima: $$d sin\theta = m\lambda$$ where $$m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$$
  * Minima: $$d sin\theta = (m - \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$ where $$m = \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$$
* Single slit apparatus
  * Minima: $$a sin\theta = m \lambda$$ where $$m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, ...$$
* Small angle approximation: $$sin\theta \approx tan\theta \approx \frac{y}{L}$$
* Example problems for double slits, single slits, and diffraction gratings

## üìù Practice Problems

1. A double slit apparatus has a slit separation of 0.20 mm and is 1.5 meters away from a screen. If I shine coherent light with a wavelength of 700 nm onto the screen, what are the positions of the central, first, second, and third maxima with respect to the center?
2. A diffraction grating has a slit separation of 0.10 mm. If I shine coherent light with a wavelength of 650 nm onto the apparatus and view the pattern on a screen, what is the maximum, theoretical number of maxima that I would see?
3. You set up a single slit apparatus and measure the third order minimum at an angle of $$4^\circ$$. If the frequency of the light on the apparatus is $$6 \times 10^{14}$$ Hz, what is the width of the slit?
