title: Error Analysis
topics:
  - Accuracy versus precision
  - Gross / human errors
  - Random errors
  - Systemic errors
  - Error mitigation techniques
objectives:
  - Explain the difference between accuracy and precision
  - Compare and contrast three major types of errors - gross / human, random, and systemic.
  - Classify examples of errors as gross / human, random, or systemic
  - Discuss different strategies to overcome errors in experiments

* Accuracy vs. precision
* Gross / human errors
  * Errors that come from human oversight / mistakes (e.g. I forgot to read the directions)
  * Not an acceptable error in the lab
  * If you report these as errors, I will not count them as correct 😓
* Random errors
  * Mainly affect precision, not accuracy
  * Relatively easy to spot compared to systemic errors
  * Relatively easy to overcome compared to systemic errors (e.g. repeated measurements, larger sample size, control extraneous variables)
* Systemic errors
  * Mainly affect accuracy, not precision
  * Can be difficult to spot
