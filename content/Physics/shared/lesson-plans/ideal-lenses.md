## üìã Sequence

We will cover converging and diverging lenses, touching on the following details:

* Positive / negative conventions
* Object further out than the focal point
* Object closer in than the focal point
* Object at the focal point

## üìù Practice Problems

For each of the problems below, sketch out a ray diagram of the system before doing any calculations.

1. An object is placed 10 cm in front of a converging lens with a focal length of 25 cm. What is the image distance from the lens? Is it in front of or behind the lens?
2. An object is placed 30 cm in front of a diverging lens with a focal length of 10 cm. What is the magnification of the final image?
3. An object is placed 45 cm in front of a converging lens with a focal length of 50 cm. What is the magnification of the final image?
